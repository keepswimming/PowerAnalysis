        "**Factors of Power Analysis to Consider:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Effect Size**: This is the magnitude of the difference you expect to detect between groups. Larger effect sizes generally require smaller sample sizes to achieve the same power.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Significance Level (α)**: This is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error). Commonly used significance levels are 0.05 or 0.01.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Power (1 - β)**: This is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (i.e., detecting a true effect). A common target for power is 0.8 (80%).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Sample Size**: The number of observations in each group. Larger sample sizes increase the power of the test.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Variability (Standard Deviation)**: The amount of variability in the data. Higher variability can reduce power, requiring larger sample sizes to detect the same effect.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Test Type**: The type of statistical test you are using (e.g., t-test, chi-square test). Different tests have different power characteristics.\n",
        "One-tailed vs. **Two-tailed Tests: One-tailed tests have more power to detect an effect in one direction, while two-tailed tests are more conservative and can detect effects in both directions.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Assumptions**: Ensure that the assumptions of the statistical test are met (e.g., normality, homogeneity of variance).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Practical Considerations**: Consider the feasibility of collecting the required sample size, ethical considerations, and the potential impact of the findings."
